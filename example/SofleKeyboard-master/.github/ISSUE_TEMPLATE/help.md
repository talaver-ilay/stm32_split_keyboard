**What steps have you taken**
* [ ] I have searched the Issues page
* [ ] I have read the documentation 
* [ ] For LED issues I have checked the following things 
        - the pro micro is programmed (and currently telling the LEDs to do something)
        - the pro micro is powered (and showing LEDs)
        - the LEDs are powered (check 5v across pins 1 and 3 of J1)
        - are any of the LEDs showing 

**What is the issue?**
_Please also include what other components you are having issues with - is the software QMK or the configurator, include pictures of your LEDs or soldering issues etc._
